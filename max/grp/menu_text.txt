total of 21 "unique" buttons, but some kanji are recycled:
  主砲 = main gun
  副砲 = secondary gun
  砲弾 = shells (note: not recycled, has unique left-side graphic)
  
  装備 = attack
  守備 = defense
  装甲 = armor (note: also not recycled, for some reason)
  
  
  

  * actually, the game doesn't recycle 装 for the tank status screen, so that frees up a little space. we should only need one extra button (put in font)
