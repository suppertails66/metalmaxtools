// Names for the rental tanks. These are 6 bytes instead of 7 like the player
// tanks because it's too much damn trouble to change it.

// The game assigns all rental tanks the same initial name, then updates the
// "model number" digit in code when a tank is actually rented. I've modified
// that routine to set byte 6 of the name (the last character) instead of
// byte 4.

// レンタ０ごう
RENT-0[END]
// レンタ０ごう
