Notes on uses for each of the script regions:

  Region 00 -- Item names
  Region 01 -- Enemy names
  Region 02 -- Mostly menus and system messages, some tilemaps
  Region 03 -- Various tank menus and tilemaps
  Region 04 -- Shop labels, wanted descriptions, other stuff
  Region 05 -- Main dialogue 1
  Region 06 -- Lots of shop messages
  Region 07 -- More shop stuff
  Region 08 -- Tank status menus and related strings
  Region 09 -- Mostly tilemaps for pieces of the interface (used for
               dictionary lookups in tilemap mode)
  Region 0A -- Battle messages
  Region 0B -- Main dialogue 2
  Region 0C -- Prefixes displayed before currently speaking character's
               dialogue (see SPKR opcode)
  Region 0D -- Menus, menu tilemaps, and some miscellaneous stuff like the
               yes/no prompt
  Region 0E -- Main dialogue 3
  Region 0F -- Dialogue displayed in the "wide window" for story events
  Region 10 -- More shop and shop-like dialogue
  Region 11 -- Dictionary. Don't translate; the build script doesn't even
               read this or the other dictionary regions.
               If it turns out some of these scripts are run explicitly
               somewhere, I'll have to update things to work around that,
               but from what I've seen that doesn't happen.
  Region 12 -- Mostly tank status screen subcomponents, also some Noah
               dialogue that I guess wouldn't fit anywhere else
  Region 13 -- Dictionary, don't translate
  Region 14 -- Dictionary, don't translate
  Region 15 -- Credits and end-game messages
