This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Famicom game Metal Max.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC and libpng.

Get a ROM image of the original game. This should be the No-Intro verified dump
with an iNES header. Specifications:

  No-Intro filename: Metal Max (Japan).nes
  CRC32:             334f45bb
  MD5:               8d029bd9c53d0b49215fa1bf2bf77bbb
  SHA-1:             6219be1826d51ec5a53aaed2efe5520afcee4ae9

Rename it "max.nes" and place it in the "max" folder. Then:

$ cd max
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as max_en.nes.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

See COPYING. Basically, everything by me (Supper) is GPLv3, and everything else
is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
